# Intro to R

# Creating a vector of data
v <- c (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Getting the first element in an array
v[1]

# Getting the 2nd to 4th element in an array
v[2:4]


#Importing data from the exiting data file (CSV)
# Loading data from CSV file

data <- read.csv(",/data/donors2008.csv")

# Printing the structure of the data
str(data)

# Printing the summary of the data
summary(data)


#Data, Format, Mathematic Operations
  
# Creaet varaible x and y, note that R use "<-" as equal sign
x <- 3
y <- 10

# Addition/Subtraction
x + y
x - y

# Multiplication/Division
x * y
x / y

# Exponent/Power
x**y
x^y

# Modulus (x mod y)
x%%y


#Matrix Algebra in R
  
# Create matrix d in R
d = matrix(c(10, 20, 30), nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
d

# Create matrix A in R
A = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 
             -4, -5, -6, 
             7, -8, 9),
           nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
A

# Find the determinant for matrix A in R
det(A)

# Solving the variable matrix x
solve(A, d)


# Generate 10 random numbers in an array
w = runif(10, min=0, max=100)

# Minimum value in the array
min(w)

# Maximum value in the array
max(w)

# Range of the array
range(w)

# 90th Percentile in the array
quantile(w, .90)

# Median of the array
median(w)

# Mean/Average of the array
mean(w)

# Mode of the array
# Note that there is no build in function in base R to find mode of set of numbers. 
# However, you can find other alternative libraries to help finding mode in an array, which I am not going to cover here.

# Variance of array w
var(w)

# Standard deviation of array w
